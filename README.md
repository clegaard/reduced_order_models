# Reduced Order Modelling


## Installing Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for the dependencies.
To create a and activate a new environment *venv*:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
The dependencies can then be installed as:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Ubuntu you may need to install a GUI backend for matplotlib, such as tkinter
``` bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
## Running the code

The scripts are invoked from the command line as follows:
```
python3 pdes.py
```# reduced_order_models
