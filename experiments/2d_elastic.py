# elastic problem
# derive from equilibrium equations
# F are the forces
# U are the field variables
# K matrix is stiffness matrix
#
# process for deriving K:
# Select an element type
# For each element type a square K matric can be formed
# A total K matrix is formed using connectivity information
#
# F = K U
