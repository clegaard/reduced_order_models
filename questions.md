# Implement Galerkin projection

# Tasks

- [x] Should we be looking at M = (I + K\*Î”t) or K when looking at values of matrices?
- [ ] Build a pipeline that can do simulation of the darcy blocks

# Notes

For a single training trajectory, the reduced order model seems to optimize very well.
When comparing the estimated matrix with the true, it is difficult to spot any difference by eye.
